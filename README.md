Psychology Expermients

This app is aimed at helping Psychology PhD students to collect data for their experiments and thesis.

It includes 3 experiements:
  - Stroop
  - Go-no-go
  - Emotion capturing

And some questionnaires between the experiments

The user has to give his/her consent before performing the experiments, and the results of the experiments are stored in a cloud database which can be downloaded using a master app.
